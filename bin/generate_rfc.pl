=head1 NAME

bin/generate_rfc.pl - regenerate the Corinna RFC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    perl bin/generate_rfc.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program reads the `config/rfcs` to determine what files in the
`templates` directory should be read and written out as part of the full RFCs.
It reads each of the files in the `templates/rfc` directory and will rewrite
each markdown `^#` header with a corresponding section number such as `3.2.3`.
This will make it easier, later, to refer to different portions of the RFC
when it's presented.
