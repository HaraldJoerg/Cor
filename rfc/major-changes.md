Due to the fast-moving nature of this project, we won't note every little
change to the RFC. You can always clone the repo and read the commits.
Instead, we'll cover major changes here.

# Change Log

## September 21, 2021

- Version numbers no longer limited to semver. All current Perl version
  formats intended to be supported.
- Classes which both inherit and consume roles must now declare the parent
  before the roles (previously, the order was not relevant).
- Method access levels such as `common`, `private`, and `overrides` are now
  attributes that come between the method name and the argument list:

  method foo :overrides ($bar, $baz) { ... }

## August 26, 2021

- Class slots now declared with `my`. They do not take attributes.

## August 19, 2021

- Slot declaration keyword renamed from `has` to `slot`

## August 14, 2021

- First draft of RFC released as markdown in github repo so that pull requests
  can be received. Wiki is noted to primarily be of historical interest.
