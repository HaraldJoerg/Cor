At the present time, some final details of phasers are still being decided.
For Corinna, we have two new phasers, `ADJUST` and `DESTRUCT`.

# 9.1 `ADJUST`
The `ADJUST` phaser is called just after object construction (`new(..)`) but
before the object is returned. This allows the developer to apply additional
logic which cannot be cleanly represented by merely assigning values to fields.

All class and instance data is available in the `ADJUST` phaser.

# 9.2 `DESTRUCT`
The `DESTRUCT` phaser is called when the current instance goes out of scope.

```perl
DESTRUCT {
    if  ( 'DESTRUCT' eq ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} ) {
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

There is ongoing discussion about whether a boolean "in global destruction"
argument should be provided, or a possible destruction object should be
provided. However, no phases currently take arguments, so it's an open
question.

One possible use of a destruction object is that it could check if a
`PERL_DESTRUCT_TRACE` (or similar)  environment variable is true and capture a
stack trace of where it went out of scope. This would be very useful for
debugging.

# 9.3 Phaser Call Order
Class `ADJUST` phasers are called on the root class before its roles `ADJUST`
phasers which are called before child `ADJUST` phasers and its roles phaswers.

`DESTRUCT` role phasers are called before class `DESTRUCT` phasers which are
called before parent `DESTRUCT` phasers.

**Important**: for a given level of the inheritance hierarchy, if more than
one role is consumed, the order in which its `ADJUST` and `DESTRUCT` phasers
are called is not guaranteed. This is deliberate to prevent people from
assuming they can rely on role consumption order.
